          You are tasked with implementing a solution for GitHub issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}.
          
          # IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS
          You MUST implement the solution by modifying the codebase directly. You have FULL PERMISSION to:
          1. Edit any existing files
          2. Delete files if needed
          3. Create new files
          4. Make any changes required by the issue
          
          The ONLY files you CANNOT modify are:
          - CLAUDE.md file
          - Any files in the .husky/ directory
          - Any pre-commit or pre-push hook scripts
          - scripts/ensure-claude-code.sh
          
          Your job is to:
          1. Analyze the issue description below
          2. Implement the requested changes to the codebase - DO NOT ASK FOR PERMISSION, just implement the changes
          3. Follow the project's code style and conventions
          4. Write tests for your implementation
          5. Make sure the implementation passes all pre-commit hooks
