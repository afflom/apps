Analyze this code for implementation stubs, mock features, placeholder implementations, faked tests, or any indication that this code is not production-ready. 

Look for:
1. TODO, FIXME, or similar comments
2. Function stubs (empty or minimal implementations)
3. Mock or dummy data instead of real implementations
4. Placeholder or temporary code
5. Test stubs or incomplete test coverage
6. Hardcoded values that should be configurable

If you find any issues, exit with a non-zero code and print your analysis to stderr. Otherwise, exit with 0.

RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
{
  "status": "PASS|FAIL", 
  "output_stream": "stdout|stderr",
  "issues": [],
  "suggestions": []
}

For each issue, provide:
- The problematic code
- Why it's an issue
- Suggestions for proper implementation based on the codebase's patterns

Code to analyze:
